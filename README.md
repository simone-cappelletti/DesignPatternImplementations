# DesignPatternImplementations

This project consists of simple practical examples of implementations of various design patterns. The list currently contains:

## Strategy pattern
In the implementation of the strategy pattern, I simulated the handling of various algorithms contained within a classic navigator. Through the graphical interface we can choose which algorithm to use to trace our route (road, by walking or public transport) and the navigator will return the points to be navigated.

## Observer pattern
In the implementation of the observer pattern, I recreated the classic publisher/subscriber case where the moment the publisher changes status, all subscribers must also be notified.

## Decorator pattern
In the implementation of the decorator pattern, I simulated a bartender calculating the cost of his cocktails. So I exploited this pattern to derive the cost of a cocktail from all its basic ingredients.
